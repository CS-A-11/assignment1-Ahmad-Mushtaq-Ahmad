This is a project Ive started as part of my reimplmentation of a research tool called UPMiner. Its purpose is to recommend API usage sequences after mining API usages from source code


For more details see [Mining succinct and high-coverage API usage patterns from source code](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2487146).
